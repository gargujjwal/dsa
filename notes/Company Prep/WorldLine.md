# Technical Questions
## 1. Tell me about your projects:
I've worked on several significant projects that showcase my full-stack development skills:

1. JobPortal: This is a full-stack job application platform I built using Spring Boot for the backend and Next.js for the frontend. It features separate interfaces for candidates and recruiters, allowing job posting and application functionalities.

2. Greenfield International School Digitalization: This was a comprehensive 6-month project to digitize school operations for over 1200 students. We implemented modules for fee management, attendance tracking, notifications, and homework management.

3. Forklify: This is a recipe sharing platform I developed using Next.js, NextAuth.js, and MongoDB. It allows users to perform CRUD operations on recipes, bookmark dishes, and manage collections.

4. Expense Tracker: This is a cross-platform mobile application I created using React Native and Expo, helping users manage their finances effectively.

## 2. Why did you make these projects?

1. JobPortal: I created this project to address the gap between job seekers and recruiters. I wanted to create a streamlined platform that makes the job search and recruitment process more efficient. It also allowed me to integrate my knowledge of Spring Boot and Next.js in a real-world application

2. Greenfield International School Digitalization: This project was born out of the need to modernize school operations. The goal was to improve efficiency, reduce paperwork, and provide better communication between the school, students, and parents. It was an opportunity to create a system that could have a tangible impact on daily operations.

3. Forklify: I developed Forklify out of a passion for cooking and a desire to create a community where people could share and discover recipes. It was also an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of Next.js and work with user authentication and database management.

4. Expense Tracker: I built this app to help people better manage their finances. As a student, I realised the importance of tracking expenses, and I wanted to create a tool that would make this process easier and more accessible through mobile devices."

## 3. What did you learn in your internship:

During my internship at Valsco Technology Pvt. Ltd. as a Backend Developer, I gained valuable real-world experience. I learned how to implement SEO strategies, achieving top 5 ranking on Google search for the company's marketing website. I also honed my skills in web scraping, using tools like Puppeteer with Node.js and TypeScript for database seeding. 

I had the opportunity to work on integrating payment gateways, specifically the PhonePe payment gateway, which taught me about secure financial transactions in web applications. Additionally, I developed both frontend and backend components for a News Section in the 'Jurident' product, which improved my full-stack development skills.

This internship taught me how to work in a professional environment, collaborate with team members, and apply my theoretical knowledge to practical, business-oriented solutions.

## 4. Tell me about the Greenfield project and how you learned teamwork there:

The Greenfield International School Digitalisation project was a comprehensive 6-month initiative where I worked collaboratively with another developer to create a digital ecosystem for school operations. We designed and implemented modules for fee management, attendance tracking, notification systems, and homework management, serving over 1200 students.

This project was a significant learning experience in teamwork:

1. Division of responsibilities: We had to effectively divide tasks based on our strengths and the project requirements. This taught me the importance of clear communication and understanding each team member's capabilities.

2. Collaborative problem-solving: We often faced complex challenges that required us to brainstorm together. This improved my ability to articulate technical ideas and consider different perspectives.

3. Code integration: Working on different modules simultaneously meant we had to regularly integrate our code. This taught me the importance of consistent coding standards, clear documentation, and effective use of version control systems.

4. Time management: With multiple modules and a 6-month timeline, we had to carefully plan and stick to deadlines. This improved my project management skills and taught me how to balance different priorities.

5. Conflict resolution: Inevitably, we sometimes had differing opinions on implementation details. Learning to discuss these professionally, compromise when necessary, and make decisions for the project's best interest was invaluable.

6. Continuous communication: Regular check-ins and updates were crucial. This taught me the importance of keeping team members informed and aligned throughout the project lifecycle.

This project significantly enhanced my teamwork skills, teaching me that effective collaboration is key to successfully delivering large-scale, complex projects.

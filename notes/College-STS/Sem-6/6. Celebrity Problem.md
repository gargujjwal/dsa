## Solutions

### Brute

1. For each person check if the current person is a celebrity or not
2. A person is considered celebrity if he satisfies 2 condition
   1. His row of matrix is entirely made up of 0 (he doesn't know anybody)
   2. In every person's row except his, his column would be marked as 1 (he is
      known by everybody)

```java
public int brute(int[][] mat, int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (_is_celebrity(i, mat)) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

### Optimal using Stack

1. Push all people in stack, ie, 0 to n.
2. Pop out two numbers from stack until stack size is 1, and check following
   things
   1. if first knows second, then first can't be a celebrity. So put second
      back in
   2. If second knows first, then second can't be a celebrity. So put first
      back in
3. At last with only single element in stack, if that person is actually a
   celebrity and return accordingly

```java
public int optimal(int[][] mat, int n) {
    Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        stack.push(i);
    }

    while (stack.size() != 1) {
        int first = stack.pop();
        int sec = stack.pop();

        if (_knows(first, sec, mat)) {
            stack.push(sec);
        } else if (_knows(sec, first, mat)) {
            stack.push(first);
        }
    }

    int possbileCelebrity = stack.pop();

    return _is_celebrity(possbileCelebrity, mat) ? possbileCelebrity : -1;
}
```

#### Used functions

```java
private boolean _knows(int first, int sec, int[][] mat) {
    return mat[first][sec] == 1;
}

private boolean _is_celebrity(int person, int[][] mat) {
    // check row if all 0s
    boolean rowIsAllZero = true;
    for (int j = 0; j < mat.length; j++) {
        rowIsAllZero = mat[person][j] == 0;
        if (!rowIsAllZero) {
            break;
        }
    }

    // check col is all 1s
    boolean colIsAllOne = true;
    for (int j = 0; j < mat.length; j++) {
        if (person == j) {
            continue;
        }

        colIsAllOne = mat[j][person] == 1;
        if (!colIsAllOne) {
            break;
        }
    }

    return rowIsAllZero && colIsAllOne;
}
```
